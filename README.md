# PhantomBot Automation
It is a simple script. Works for Debian's, Ubuntu's or Red Hat's distributions

## Instalation

First at all, you need generate a client id from Twitch, cause this stuff getting requests from Twitch API ([more here](https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843)):
[Generate your own Client ID here](https://www.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/clients/new)

Next step is initializing script to install dependences. Very important thing: You need launch it as Root.

`sudo sh phantombot.sh init`

## Issue? 
Just request new issue if you find some buggy stuff. I'll try fixing this issue cause I can.
